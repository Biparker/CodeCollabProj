# Feature 5: CORS Configuration for Credentials - COMPLETED

## Summary
Verified and confirmed that the CORS configuration in `server/index.js` is already properly configured to support credentials for httpOnly cookie authentication.

## Configuration Verified (lines 99-108):
```javascript
const corsOptions = {
  origin: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
    ? [process.env.FRONTEND_URL]
    : ['http://localhost:3000', 'http://127.0.0.1:3000'],
  credentials: true,
  optionsSuccessStatus: 200,
  methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE', 'OPTIONS'],
  allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization'],
};
```

## Key Points:
1. `credentials: true` - Already set, enables cookies to be sent with cross-origin requests
2. Explicit origins (not `'*'`) - Required when `credentials: true` is set
3. Production uses `FRONTEND_URL` environment variable
4. Development uses explicit localhost URLs

## No Changes Required
The CORS configuration was already correctly set up for httpOnly cookie support. No code modifications were necessary.
