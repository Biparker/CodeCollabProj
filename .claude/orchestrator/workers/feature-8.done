# Feature 8: Update useAuth hook for httpOnly cookie authentication

## Summary
Updated the `useAuth` hook in `client/src/hooks/auth/useAuth.js` to work with cookie-based authentication instead of requiring localStorage tokens.

## Changes Made
1. **Changed `isAuthenticated` logic**: Now based solely on user data from the `/auth/me` response (`!!user`), rather than requiring both user data AND localStorage tokens.

2. **Enabled query by default**: Set `enabled: true` on the TanStack Query so it always attempts to fetch user data. With httpOnly cookies, the browser automatically sends cookies with requests (via `withCredentials: true` in axios), allowing authentication to work without localStorage tokens.

3. **Added `isFetched` property**: Exposes the query's `isFetched` state, which helps components determine if the initial authentication check is complete.

4. **Backward compatibility**: All token-related properties (`accessToken`, `refreshToken`, `hasValidTokens`, `isTokenExpired`, `token`) are preserved but marked as deprecated. They will return `null` when using pure httpOnly cookie auth.

5. **Updated documentation**: Added comprehensive JSDoc comments explaining the migration from localStorage to httpOnly cookies.

## Files Modified
- `client/src/hooks/auth/useAuth.js`

## Backward Compatibility
- Components using `isAuthenticated`, `user`, `isLoading`, `hasRole`, and other user-based properties work unchanged
- Components using deprecated `token` property (like PrivateRoute for debug logging) continue to work, though `token` will be `null` with cookie-based auth
- The hook works with both httpOnly cookies and legacy localStorage tokens during the migration period
