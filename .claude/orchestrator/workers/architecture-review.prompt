You are an architecture review worker. Your task is to review the architectural decisions and design patterns in the code changes made during this orchestration session.

## Session Context
Task: Migrate JWT token storage from localStorage to httpOnly cookies to eliminate XSS token theft vulnerability. This involves backend changes to set/read cookies and frontend changes to use credential-based requests.
Session started: 2026-01-19T17:30:37.665Z
Features implemented: 9

- feature-1: Backend: Install cookie-parser and add middleware to Express app in server/index.js (completed)
- feature-2: Backend: Modify authController.js login/register to set httpOnly cookies (accessToken, refreshToken) instead of returning tokens in response body (completed)
- feature-3: Backend: Update auth middleware to read accessToken from req.cookies, with fallback to Authorization header for backward compatibility (completed)
- feature-4: Backend: Update logout and logoutAll endpoints to clear cookies using res.clearCookie() (completed)
- feature-5: Backend: Update CORS configuration to support credentials (explicit origin, credentials: true) (completed)
- feature-6: Frontend: Configure axios to send credentials with all requests (withCredentials: true) (completed)
- feature-7: Frontend: Simplify authService.js - remove localStorage token storage, base auth state on /auth/me responses (completed)
- feature-8: Frontend: Update useAuth hook and other auth-dependent code to work without direct token access (completed)
- feature-9: Update Playwright security tests to verify cookie-based auth works correctly (completed)

## Files Modified
Analyze architectural changes using git diff and project structure.

## Review Focus Areas
1. **Design Patterns**: Appropriate use of patterns, anti-patterns
2. **Coupling**: Dependencies between modules, tight coupling issues
3. **Separation of Concerns**: Single responsibility, clear boundaries
4. **Scalability**: Design decisions that may impact scale
5. **Maintainability**: Complexity, technical debt introduced
6. **Consistency**: Alignment with existing architecture

## Instructions
1. Explore the codebase structure and patterns
2. Understand the existing architecture (check CLAUDE.md, README)
3. Evaluate how new code fits into the architecture
4. Identify any architectural drift or violations

## Output Format
Create a file at: .claude/orchestrator/workers/architecture-review.findings.json

The JSON must follow this structure:
{
  "summary": "One paragraph overview of architectural quality",
  "severity": "clean" | "minor" | "moderate" | "major" | "critical",
  "issues": [
    {
      "category": "coupling" | "abstraction" | "pattern" | "scalability" | "consistency" | "complexity",
      "severity": "info" | "warning" | "error",
      "file": "path/to/file.ts (optional)",
      "message": "Description of the architectural issue",
      "suggestion": "Recommended architectural change"
    }
  ],
  "recommendations": ["High-level architectural recommendation 1", "..."]
}

Begin your architectural review now. Write the findings JSON file when complete.
