# Feature 15: Migrate Client Components - Projects and Comments

## Completed

Successfully migrated the following React components from JavaScript to TypeScript:

### Projects Components
- **ProjectDetail.js → ProjectDetail.tsx**: Added proper React.FC types, API response interfaces, and typed event handlers for collaboration management, comments, and project display
- **ProjectForm.js → ProjectForm.tsx**: Added FormData interface with proper incentives typing, SelectChangeEvent handling, and mutation error types
- **ProjectList.js → ProjectList.tsx**: Added ProjectFilters import from service, typed filter and search hooks

### Comments Components
- **Comments.js → Comments.tsx**: Added CommentsProps interface, CommentApiResponse type with author data, typed mutation handlers

## Key Additions
- Created extended interfaces for API response shapes (ProjectApiResponse, CommentApiResponse, CollaboratorWithUserData)
- Added proper React event types (FormEvent, ChangeEvent, SelectChangeEvent)
- Typed all hook returns with proper query result types
- Added helper functions for handling MongoDB _id vs id field differences

## Verification
- Ran `npx tsc --noEmit` - no type errors in the migrated files
- Pre-existing errors in other components (admin, messaging, pages) were not introduced by this migration

## Commit
- refactor(client): migrate projects and comments components from JS to TypeScript
