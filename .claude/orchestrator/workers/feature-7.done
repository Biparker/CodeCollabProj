# Feature 7 Complete: Simplify authService.js for httpOnly Cookie Auth

## Summary
Refactored `client/src/services/authService.js` to support the migration from localStorage-based token storage to httpOnly cookie-based authentication.

## Changes Made

### New Method Added
- `isAuthenticatedViaCookie()`: Server-validated auth check via `/auth/me` endpoint. Returns `{authenticated: boolean, user: Object|null}`. This is the preferred method for checking auth state during the migration.

### Documentation Updates
- Added comprehensive migration note in file header explaining dual-mode support
- Added `@deprecated` JSDoc tags to all localStorage-based token methods
- Updated method comments to explain cookie-based behavior

### Methods Marked as Deprecated (kept for backward compatibility)
- `setTokens()` - Backend now sets tokens via Set-Cookie headers
- `clearTokens()` - Backend now clears cookies on logout
- `getAccessToken()` - Tokens not accessible via JS in httpOnly cookies
- `getRefreshToken()` - Tokens not accessible via JS in httpOnly cookies
- `isTokenExpired()` - Handled server-side with httpOnly cookies
- `isAuthenticated()` - Use `isAuthenticatedViaCookie()` instead
- `getValidToken()` - Token refresh handled via httpOnly cookies
- `getTokenNoRefresh()` - Deprecated
- `getToken()` - Legacy alias, deprecated

### Backward Compatibility
- All existing localStorage methods preserved and functional
- Login/register still store tokens in localStorage as fallback during migration
- Logout clears both httpOnly cookies (via server) and localStorage
