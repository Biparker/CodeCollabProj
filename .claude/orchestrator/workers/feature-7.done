# Feature 7 Complete: Migrate client utils and config to TypeScript

## Summary
Successfully migrated all client utility and configuration files from JavaScript to TypeScript.

## Files Migrated

### Config Files
1. **src/config/constants.ts** - Added `as const` assertions for literal types, exported type aliases
2. **src/config/queryClient.ts** - Typed QueryClient configuration, query key factories, cache invalidation helpers, and prefetch helpers

### Utility Files
3. **src/utils/validation.ts** - Added types for validation results, rules, and custom validators
4. **src/utils/sanitize.ts** - Typed sanitization functions with proper input/output types
5. **src/utils/logger.ts** - Created Logger interface, typed all logging methods
6. **src/utils/performance.ts** - Typed all performance utilities including debounce, throttle, memoize, cache manager
7. **src/utils/tokenEncryption.ts** - Typed encryption class with private/public method signatures
8. **src/utils/api.ts** - Complex migration with proper Axios types (AxiosInstance, InternalAxiosRequestConfig, AxiosError, AxiosResponse), typed token refresh queue

## Key TypeScript Improvements
- Used `as const` for configuration objects to get literal types
- Created proper interfaces for validation results and rules
- Typed Axios interceptors with InternalAxiosRequestConfig and AxiosResponse
- Added generic types for performance utilities (debounce, throttle, memoize)
- Used proper typing for the cache manager with TTL support
- Typed the auth service interface for lazy loading in api.ts

## Verification
