## Summary

Successfully migrated client comments and users hooks from JavaScript to TypeScript.

### Files Migrated

**Comments domain:**
- `useComments.js` → `useComments.ts` - List comments for a project with proper typing
- `useCommentMutations.js` → `useCommentMutations.ts` - Create/update/delete comment mutations with typed variables
- `index.js` → `index.ts` - Central export for comment hooks

**Users domain:**
- `useUsers.js` → `useUsers.ts` - User listing, search, projects, stats hooks with typed query options
- `useProfileMutations.js` → `useProfileMutations.ts` - Profile update, avatar upload/delete, follow mutations
- `useMessaging.js` → `useMessaging.ts` - Direct messaging hooks (get/send/delete messages)
- `index.js` → `index.ts` - Central export for user hooks

### Key Changes

1. Added proper TypeScript types for all hooks using TanStack Query types
2. Created interface types for mutation variables (e.g., `UpdateCommentVariables`, `DeleteCommentVariables`)
3. Used `UseQueryResult` and `UseMutationResult` return types for proper typing
4. Imported types from `client/src/types/` and service types from the respective service files
5. Used `Omit` utility type to create custom query options types
6. Added notes for backend features not yet implemented (likes, replies for comments)
7. Extended response types for avatar operations that include user data

### Verification

- Ran `npx tsc --noEmit` - TypeScript compilation passes with no errors
- All old JS files removed
- New TS files follow consistent patterns with existing migrated hooks
