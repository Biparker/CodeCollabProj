## Files to Review
Review all recently modified files using git diff or file timestamps.

## Review Focus Areas
1. **Code Quality**: Naming, readability, maintainability
2. **Bug Detection**: Logic errors, edge cases, null checks
3. **Security**: Input validation, injection vulnerabilities
4. **Test Coverage**: Missing tests, untested edge cases
5. **Code Patterns**: Consistency with existing patterns
6. **Performance**: Obvious inefficiencies, N+1 queries

## Instructions
1. Use Read, Glob, and Grep to examine the codebase
2. Focus on files modified during this session
3. Look for patterns of issues, not just individual problems
4. Provide actionable suggestions

## Output Format
Create a file at: .claude/orchestrator/workers/code-review.findings.json

The JSON must follow this structure:
{
  "summary": "One paragraph overview of code quality",
  "severity": "clean" | "minor" | "moderate" | "major" | "critical",
  "issues": [
    {
      "category": "bug" | "security" | "style" | "performance" | "test-coverage" | "maintainability",
      "severity": "info" | "warning" | "error",
      "file": "path/to/file.ts",
      "line": 42,
      "message": "Description of the issue",
      "suggestion": "How to fix it"
    }
  ],
  "recommendations": ["High-level recommendation 1", "..."]
}
