# Feature 3 Complete: Auth Middleware Cookie Support

## Summary
Updated `server/middleware/auth.js` to read the access token from httpOnly cookies with fallback to the Authorization header.

## Changes Made
- Modified `server/middleware/auth.js` to:
  1. First check `req.cookies?.accessToken` for the JWT token
  2. Fall back to `req.header('Authorization')?.replace('Bearer ', '')` if no cookie is present

This enables both cookie-based (XSS-resistant) and header-based authentication, allowing backward compatibility during the migration period.

## Verification
- Cookie-parser middleware was already configured in `server/index.js` (line 123)
- Cookie-parser dependency was already installed (`cookie-parser": "^1.4.7"`)
- Server tests pass (unrelated logger test failures are pre-existing)

## Commit
`feat(auth): read accessToken from httpOnly cookie with header fallback`
