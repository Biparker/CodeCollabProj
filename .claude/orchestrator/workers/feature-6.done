Feature: Configure axios to send credentials with all requests

Summary:
- Added `withCredentials: true` to the axios instance configuration in `client/src/utils/api.js`
- This ensures that httpOnly cookies (containing JWT tokens) are automatically sent with every API request to the backend
- The change supports the migration from localStorage-based token storage to httpOnly cookie-based authentication

File modified:
- client/src/utils/api.js (line 13)

Status: COMPLETED
