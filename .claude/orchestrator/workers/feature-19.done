Feature 19: Migrate client tests to TypeScript - COMPLETED

## Summary
Successfully migrated the client test files from JavaScript to TypeScript.

## Changes Made
- Converted `client/src/__tests__/utils/validation.test.js` to `validation.test.ts`
- Added proper TypeScript imports including `ValidationRules` type from the validation utility
- Added typed interface `TestFormData` for form validation tests
- All 16 tests continue to pass

## Files Changed
- `client/src/__tests__/utils/validation.test.js` → `validation.test.ts` (renamed/migrated)

## Verification
- Ran `npm test -- --watchAll=false` in client directory
- All 16 tests pass successfully

## Notes
- The client already had `@types/jest` installed in devDependencies
- No additional type packages were needed since the validation utility module already exports proper TypeScript types
- The test file was the only test file found in the client (no other .test.js or .spec.js files existed)
