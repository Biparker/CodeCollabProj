## Feature 20: Migrate Playwright E2E tests to TypeScript

### Summary
Successfully migrated all Playwright E2E tests from JavaScript to TypeScript.

### Changes Made

1. **playwright.config.ts** (new)
   - Converted from `playwright.config.js`
   - Uses ES module imports (`import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test'`)
   - Exports configuration using `export default`
   - Maintains all original configuration (testDir, webServer, projects)

2. **tests/e2e/cookie-auth-security.spec.ts** (new)
   - Converted from `cookie-auth-security.spec.js`
   - Added proper TypeScript imports (`test, expect, Page, APIRequestContext`)
   - Defined interfaces for test data:
     - `StorageData` for localStorage/sessionStorage data
     - `SecurityCheckResult` for XSS protection test results
     - `RequestInfo` for CORS request tracking
   - Added type annotations to `page.evaluate()` callbacks
   - Fixed `request.newContext()` to use `playwright.request.newContext()` (proper Playwright API)
   - Used non-null assertions (`!`) where values are checked by expect before use

3. **tsconfig.json** (updated)
   - Added `"DOM"` to `lib` array for browser-context type support
   - Added `"types": ["node"]` for Node.js global types

4. **package.json** (updated)
   - Added `@playwright/test` as dev dependency
   - Added `typescript` as dev dependency
   - Added `@types/node` as dev dependency

### Deleted Files
- `playwright.config.js` (replaced by .ts version)
- `tests/e2e/cookie-auth-security.spec.js` (replaced by .ts version)

### Verification
- `npx playwright test --list` successfully lists all 13 tests
- TypeScript type-checking passes (`npx tsc --noEmit`)
- All tests properly use Playwright types (Page, expect, test, APIRequestContext)

### Notes
- The tests use `page.evaluate()` for browser-context code, which required adding DOM types to tsconfig
- The `playwright.request.newContext()` pattern is used for isolated API request contexts
